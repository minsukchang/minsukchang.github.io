Hi :) I am a researcher on the [PAIR (People and AI Research)](https://pair.withgoogle.com/) team at [Google AI](https://ai.google/). I am interested in our and other agents' (in)ability to acquire new skills through interations.

<!-- I have a PhD in Computer Science from [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr){:target="\_blank"}. During my PhD, I was advised by [Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com){:target="\_blank"} in the [KIXLAB](http://kixlab.org){:target="\_blank"}. Before joining Google, I was a research scientist and a technical leader at [Naver AI](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab), where I led research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Machine Learning. -->

<!-- In the past,
I studied Computer Science, Financial Engineering from KAIST, Finance from Simon Business School @ University of Rochester, and Statistics from Rutgers University. I have worked at an Hedge Fund in NYC trying to beat the market by relentlessly crunching numbers prior to coming (back) to KAIST. I've spent two years in the reinforcement learning (as a subfield of machine learning) research group at KAIST as a Ph.D student before joining KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab). -->

<!-- I taught lab sessions for the mandatory Introduction to Programming course at KAIST from 2015-2018 as a Head TA. I enjoyed working with 40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester. -->
