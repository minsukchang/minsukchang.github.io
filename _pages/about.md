Hi :) I am a research scientist on the [PAIR (People and AI Research)](https://pair.withgoogle.com/) team at [Google Research](https://research.google/). I am also an adjunct professor at the [KAIST Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/).

I am interested in our and other agents' (in)ability to acquire new skills/knowledge through interaction. I build and study the  the intricate dynamics of learning processes, seeking to understand how agents can effectively gather information, adapt to new situations, and expand their repertoire of behaviors.

I often like to draw parallels between human learning and the learning capabilities of artificial agents. I find it exciting when insights gained from understanding human learning can be applied to enhance the learning abilities of AI systems, and vice versa.


<!-- I hold a PhD in Computer Science from [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr){:target="\_blank"}. During my PhD, I was advised by [Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com){:target="\_blank"} in the [KIXLAB](http://kixlab.org){:target="\_blank"}. Before joining Google, I was a research scientist and a technical leader at [Naver AI](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab), where I led research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Machine Learning. -->

<!-- In the past,
I studied Computer Science, Financial Engineering from KAIST, Finance from Simon Business School @ University of Rochester, and Statistics from Rutgers University. I have worked at an Hedge Fund in NYC trying to beat the market by relentlessly crunching numbers prior to coming (back) to KAIST. I've spent two years in the reinforcement learning (as a subfield of machine learning) research group at KAIST as a Ph.D student before joining KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab). -->

<!-- I taught lab sessions for the mandatory Introduction to Programming course at KAIST from 2015-2018 as a Head TA. I enjoyed working with 40 TAs and interacting with 450-500 students each semester. -->
